This project delves into 120 years of Olympic Games, covering events from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, offering comprehensive insights through four distinct analyses focusing on Summer Olympics:

- Medal Tally Analysis:

Provides a detailed breakdown of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals won by each participating nation.

- Overall Analysis:

Highlights top statistics, trends in participating nations, events, athletes, and identifies the most successful athlete in each sport.
- Country-wise Analysis:

Displays the medal tally for a selected country, identifies the sports in which the country excels, and lists the top 10 athletes of that nation.
- Athlete-wise Analysis:

Analyzes the age distribution among gold medalists, presents a scatterplot comparing height vs weight for winners and non-winners, and explores the participation rates of men vs women.
